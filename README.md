 The Crop_recommendation.csv dataset is a structured resource for building machine learning models in agriculture. It includes soil properties (pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) and weather data (temperature, rainfall) as features, with target labels for crops like rice and maize. It supports precision farming by aligning crops with conditions.
